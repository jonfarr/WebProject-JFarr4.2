        <a href="https://mcast.edu.mt/how-to-apply-online-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

        </a>one will find guides and resources intended to further facilitate online applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        All residents in Malta bearing a Maltese ID Document are expected to submit their online application after creating their MCAST CMIS account/profile (combined process at one go) using their active and valid eID credentials, which may be obtained from the Identità Agency. Only in exceptional circumstances where it is clearly evidenced that the applicant is not entitled to an eID, will a different channel of application be utilised, upon clear guidance by the MCAST Admissionsand Records Department (ARD).
    </p>

    <p>
        The Online Application on the MCAST Admissions Portal is made up of the following online pages:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
        Personal details as pushed from the applicant's Maltese eID, being the only source of validation. This first page is totally dependent on the Identità Agency rather than within MCAST's control.
        </li>
        <li>
        A section which allows applicants to upload clear and crisp scans of all certificates and qualification documents (full pages thereof), as required for the vetting process.
        </li>
        <li>
        General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) page. This must be completed attentively, without which the application cannot be submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
        Choosing the course title one would be applying for.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The creation of one's account/profile on MCAST CMIS using eID is done only once, at the very first time the applicant submits an application. Once the applicant's account/profile is set up and validated, future applications become much simpler and will generally only require confirmation of GDPR consents and completion of the final application page.
